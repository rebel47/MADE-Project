# Title
Unemployment Rate and GDP Growth Correlation in the United States

## Description

Understanding the link between unemployment rate and economic growth which can reveal key insights into the U.S. economy. In this project I'll explores the relationship between unemployment rates and real GDP growth over both long-term and recent periods. By analyzing annual data from 1960 to 2023 and quarterly data from the last 10 years, we aim to identify patterns, cycles, and short-term variations. Examining how these indicators move together or diverge can provide a clearer understanding of their impact on each other and potentially inform economic policies and forecasts. This dual-level analysis will help us see how changes in employment and economic output align or differ during various economic cycles.
