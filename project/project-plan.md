## Title
<!-- Give your project a short title. -->
Income Inequality and Crime Rate by State: Correlation Analysis

## Main Question

<!-- Think about one main question you want to answer based on the data. -->
1. Is there a correlation between income inequality and crime rates across U.S. states, and if so, does this correlation vary by type of crime?

## Description

<!-- Describe your data science project in max. 200 words. Consider writing about why and how you attempt it. -->
This project explores the relationship between income inequality and crime rates in the United States. Income inequality, often measured using the Gini Index, is a critical indicator of socio-economic disparity, and its potential impact on crime rates is a relevant topic for policymakers and researchers alike. By analyzing state-level data on both income inequality and crime rates, this project aims to identify possible trends or correlations. Findings from this project may provide insights into whether states with higher levels of income disparity also experience higher crime rates and could inform policies to address socio-economic challenges.
